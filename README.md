# How to use the Streamlit Website.
1) download the zipped .nc file.
2) unzip it somewhere
3) go to https://aquaticrigtest.streamlit.app/
4) upload that .nc file to the website.
5) It should display a matplotlib graph with buttons at the top for changing the depth in the water :) At the bottom it will also give some general information about the .nc file.
